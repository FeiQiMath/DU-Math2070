  <h4> A brief description of the present work</h4>

  <p> In the representation theory of many important algebraic structures, such as Lie algebras,
    groups (or group algebras), commutative associative algebras, Hopf algebras or quantum
    groups, tensor product operations among modules play a central role. They not only give
    new modules from known ones, but they of course also provide a powerful tool for studying
    modules. More significantly, suitable categories of modules for such algebras, equipped
    with tensor product operations and appropriate natural isomorphisms, and so on, become
    symmetric or braided tensor categories, and this tensor category structure is always used,
    even when it is not explicitly discussed.</p>
