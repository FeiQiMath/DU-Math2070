  <title>Introduction and strongly graded algebras and their generalized modules</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> In this paper, Part I of a series of eight papers, we give a detailed overview of logarithmic
      tensor category theory, state our main results and introduce the basic objects that we shall
      study in this work. We include a brief discussion of some of the recent applications of this
      theory, and also a discussion of some recent literature. The sections, equations, theorems
      and so on are numbered globally in the series of papers rather than within each paper, so
      that for example equation $(a.b)$ is the b-th labeled equation in Section a, which is contained
      in the paper indicated as follows: The present paper, Part I, contains Sections 1 and 2.
      In Part II [HLZ2], which contains Section 3, we develop logarithmic formal calculus and
      study logarithmic intertwining operators. In Part III [HLZ3], which contains Section 4, we
      introduce and study intertwining maps and tensor product bifunctors. In Part IV [HLZ4],
      which contains Sections 5 and 6, we give constructions of the P(z)- and Q(z)-tensor product
      bifunctors using what we call \compatibility conditions" and certain other conditions. In
      Part V [HLZ5], which contains Sections 7 and 8, we study products and iterates of intertwining
      maps and of logarithmic intertwining operators and we begin the development of
      our analytic approach. In Part VI [HLZ6], which contains Sections 9 and 10, we construct
      the appropriate natural associativity isomorphisms between triple tensor product functors.
      In Part VII [HLZ7], which contains Section 11, we give sufficient conditions for the existence
      of the associativity isomorphisms. In Part VIII [HLZ8], which contains Section 12, we
      construct braided tensor category structure. </p>
