\section{Lecture 2 on May 27th}

0.1. How to check if a given function is a solution of an ODE.

0.2. Classification of ODEs.\\



1. Prove the formula of general solution for a first order ODE. 

1.1. Use the observation that $\mu(t) (y' + p(t) y) = (\mu(t) y)'$. 

1.2. Variation of parameter: $y = u(t)/\mu(t)$ to get $u(t) = \int \mu(t) g(t) dt$. \\

2. Remarks on the formula

2.1. The formula ONLY work for standard form. Before you proceed to find the integrating factor, make sure you start with the standard form! 

2.2. When integrating $p(t)$ to get the integrating factor, there's no need to worry about the arbitrary constant, since it does not make any difference to the final solution. [why? ]

2.3. The arbitrary constant appearing in the general solution appears in a fraction as numerator, with the integrating factor being the denominator. Don't regard it as a pure constant! \\ 

3. Examples and Review of integration techniques (with long term behavior)

3.1. $y' + 2y = e^{3t}, y(0) = 3$

3.2. $ty' -  y = t^3, y(1) = 0$

3.3. $\sin t y' + \cos t y = \sin^2 t, 0<t<2\pi$

3.4. Integration by parts: $t y' + 2 y = t (\ln 3t)^2, t>0$

3.5. $y' + y = \cos 2t$

3.6. $y' - \tan t y = \sec^2 t, 0<t<\pi/2$


\newpage

$$(1+t^2) y' + 4t y = (1+t^2)^{-2}$$

\section{Lecture 3 on May 28th}

1. The general form of a separable equation.

1.1. General Principle of Implicit Solution and Explicit Solution

1.1.1 If you are asked to find the general solution, i.e., the initial value is not specified, then an implicit solution is enough.

1.1.2.If you are asked to find the solution to an IVP, i.e., the initial value is specified, then an implicit solution is usually insufficient. You should get the explicit solution \textit{whenever possible}.

1.2. Example: $y' = xy^3 (1+x^2)^{-1/2}$.

1.3. Remarks

1.3.1. So one can see at least two information cannot be seen directly from an implicit solution: the $\pm$ branch of the interval of existence. And this is one of the reasons an  implicit solution is insufficient for IVPs. 

1.3.2. On the other hand for general solution, the above information makes no sense, as branches and interval of existence depends on the choice of initial values. This is why implicit solution is enough for general solutions.

1.3.3. Nevertheless, it's NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE to recover the the explicit solution from an implicit solution. For example, it is basically impossible to solve $y=y(x)$ with the following relation
$$y^2 + e^y = x^2 - 4$$
$$y' = \frac{x}{y + e^y}$$
In this case we can do nothing but to stop at such an unsatisfactory solution. But \textit{whenever possible}, you should solve $y=y(x)$. \\

2. Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for First Order Linear ODE

2.0. NOT All the IVP have solutions.

2.1. Statement: For the first order linear ODE with initial value
$$y' + p(t)y = g(t), y(t_0) = y_0$$
If the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
\item Both $p(t), g(t)$ are continuous over an open interval $(a,b)$.
\item This open interval contains $t_0$, aka, $a<t_0<b$.
\end{itemize}
Then there exists a unique function $y=y(t)$ over the interval $(a,b)$ that solves the IVP. 


2.2. Application: Estimate the interval of Existence without actually solving it.

2.2.1. Find the standard form first (on which the theorem is formulated). 

2.2.2. Find the \textit{singular points}, i.e. where the continuity of $p(t)$ and $g(t)$ fails.

2.2.3. Plot them on the real number line to get a big bunch of intervals. 

2.2.4. Pick the interval that contains $t_0$

2.3. Examples

2.3.1. $(t-3)y' + (\ln t) y = 2t, y(1) = 2$.

2.3.2. $ty' - y = t e^{-t}$

2.3.2. $\sin 2t y' + \tan 4t y = \frac 1 t, y(\pi/4)=0$\\


3. Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for First Order Nonlinear ODE

3.1. Statement: For the first order nonlinear ODE with initial value
$$y' = f(t,y), y(t_0)= y_0$$
If the following conditions are satisfied
\begin{itemize}
\item $f(t,y)$ is continuous NEAR $(t_0, y_0)$
\item $f_y(t,y)$ is continuous NEAR $(t_0, y_0)$
\end{itemize}
Then there exists a function $y=y(t)$ defined NEAR $t=t_0$ that solves the IVP.

3.2. Examples 

3.2.1. $y' = y^{1/3}, y(0)=1$

3.2.2. $y' = (1-x^2 -y^2)^{1/2}, y(x_0)=y_0$

3.3. Remarks

3.3.1. The nonlinear version is not as strong as the linear version, as it only concludes the ``local'' existence of a solution.  

3.3.2.  More precisely, the theorem guarantees a unique solution in a small interval $\left(t_0-\varepsilon, t_0+\varepsilon\right)$, while gave no information about how large $\varepsilon$ might be.

3.3.3. Therefore, the interval of existence to the solution CANNOT be decided from this theorem. This is one of the millions of features where nonlinear ODEs differ from linear ODEs. 

3.3.4. Nevertheless, this theorem tells whether an IVP is reasonably formulated.

1. Find the general solution to the following ODEs
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{x-e^{-x}}{y+e^y}$$

$$y' = (1-2x)y^2, y(0)=-1/6$$
$$y' = \frac{x(x^2+1)}{4y^3}, y(0)=-1/\sqrt{2}$$

3. Find the interval of existence for the following IVPs
$$y' + \frac{t^4}{(t-2)^8}y = \sqrt{t}, y(1)=8$$
$$(1-t^4) y' + (\ln t) y = \cot 2t, y(2)=0$$

\section{Lecture 4 on June 1}

All mathematical modeling has limitations. It only applies to some special cases. For this class we are not talking in detail how to construct the models, but just to show you some of the most frequently used models. \\

1. Newton's Law of Cooling

Basic assumption: The temperature of an object changes at a rate proportional to the difference between its temperature and that of its surroundings. 

Only applies to convective heat transfer. Not to be used for other kind of heat transfer


1.1. Example: Suppose the temperature of a cup of coffee obeys Newton's law of cooling. If the coffee has a temperature of 200$^\circ$F when freshly poured, and 1 minute later has cooled to 190$^\circ$F in a room at 70$^\circ$F. Determine when the coffee reaches a temperature of 150$^\circ$F. \\

2. Pollution Model

2.1. Example: A newly-built chemical factory begins to pour mercury pollutants continuously with a rate $50$ gram per day to a fresh water lake. Suppose the volume of water in the lake is constantly $V=10^6$m$^3$ and every day $2\times 10^4$m$^3$ of the water is refreshed. Find out the time it takes for the water to become undrinkable (according to EPA standards, water with mercury concentration larger than 0.002 mg/L is undrinkable). 

2.2. Example: Is it possible to control the rate of pollutant emission so the water stays potable forever? \\

3. Compound Interest

3.1. Investment

Example: Mr. and Mrs. Robinson decide to start saving money to support their 10-year-old son to college in the future. Suppose they will be able save 1000 dollars every month and they put this money into a saving account \textit{continuously} with annual interest rates 1\% \textit{compounded continuously}. How much money would they be able to get when their son now gets 18 years old. 

3.2. Loan

Example: The Peskin's loan is a type of Federal Student Loans for college students with annual interest rate 5\% compounded continuously. Suppose Mr. Qi had to borrow 20,000 dollars continuously every year to cover the tuition. How much debt will he carry after 4 years when he graduate?

Suppose after graduation, Mr. Qi will be able to save 500 dollars per month to pay his loan back. How many years will it take for Mr. Qi to finally pay off his debt? \\


4. Falling object

4.1. A body weigh 192 lb is dropped from a great height. Suppose the air resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity and the proportional constant is 12. 

(a) Find its velocity and the distance it falls as a function of time. 

(b) What is its terminal velocity?

(c) How far does it fall in 10 sec? What is its velocity at that moment? 

4.2. A man and his parachute weigh 192 lb. Assume that a safe landing velocity is 16 ft/sec and that the air resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity, equaling 1/2 lb per square foot for the cross-section area of the parachute when it's moving at 20 ft/sec. Find the minimal area of the parachute such that the terminal velocity is within the safe landing velocity.

Two more models

\section*{Homework Problems}

1. You can find the temperature inside your refrigerator without putting a thermometer inside. Take a can of soda from the refrigerator, let it warm for half an hour, then record its temperature. Let it warm
for another half an hour and record its temperature again. Suppose that the readings are $T(1/2)=45^\circ$F and $T(1) = 55^\circ$F. Assuming that the room temperature is 70$^\circ$F, what is the temperature inside the refrigerator?

2. After operating for 150 days and getting a ticket from the EPA, the company took measures to control the emission rate of mercury pollutants to the level of 10 gram/day. How many more days does it take for the water in the lake to become potable again? (Use the data in the course notes)

(bouns) Figure out the appropriate level of pollutant emission such that the water will stay drinkable forever. 

3. Suppose you financed a car of \$25,000 with annual interest rate 4\% compounded continuously. Suppose you pay the financial agency continuously. Then how much you should pay annually to pay off the debt in 3 years. 

4. (bonus) A boy weight 96 lb jumped off from building of height 100 feet with an umbrella as large as 5 square feet. Find out the velocity he touches the ground. 

(Comment: Don't be fooled by the cartoon makers who cares nothing about education!)

\section{Lecture 5 on June 2}

1. Autonomous Equation.

\section{Lecture 6 on June 3}

1. Motivation: recall how we dealt with linear ODE. Want to find a similar way to operate on some special nonlinear functions.\\

2. Exact Equations

2.1. Definition

2.2. Criterion

2.3. Examples of checking exactness:
$$(3x^2y+ 2xy^5+ 5y) + (x^3+ 5x^2y^4+ 5x)y'=0$$
$$(3x^2y+ 2xy^5+ 6y) + (x^3+ 5x^2y^4+ 5x)y'=0$$

2.3. How to recover the solution: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Check if $M_y = N_x$ to make sure the ODE is exact. \textbf{If it's not, don't you dare to continue!}
\item Integrate $M$ with respect to $x$ (or $N$ with respect to $y$) to get 
$$\Psi(x,y)=\int Mdx + h(y)$$
(or $\Psi(x,y)=\int Ndy + h(x)$)
\item Use $\displaystyle{\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial y}=N}$ (or $\Psi_x=M$) to determine $h'(y)$ (or $h'(x)$) and thus determine $h(y)$ (or $h(x)$) and thus $\Psi(x,y)$.
\end{enumerate}
2.4. Remarks: 

(1) If the $h'(y)$ is not independent of $x$, that means you messed up somewhere and don't you dare to continue!

(2) When integrate $h'(y)$, we never worry about the constant 

(3) Don't mess up with the coefficients! \\

3. Examples: 

3.1. $(3x^2y+ 2xy^5+ 5y) + (x^3+ 5x^2y^4+ 5x+2\sin 2y)y'=0$\

3.2. $(3y^2e^{x^2+y^3}+x)y' + 2x e^{x^2 + y^3} + y = 0$

3.3. $(9x^2 + y - 1) - (4y-x)y' = 0, y(1) = 0$: Explicit solution\\

4. Integrating factor methods

4.1. Formulate the equation for exactness

4.2. Impose assumptions to find the conditions

4.3. Summary of the formula 

5. Examples 

5.1. $3xy^2+2y^3 + (2x^2y +3xy^2)y'=0$

5.2. $ydx + （2xy-e^{-2y})dy=0$

\newpage
\section*{Homework}

1. Check if each of the following ODEs is exact. If it is, then find the general solution. If it is not, then try to solve it by finding an integrating factor to make an exact ODE. In case you cannot find an integrating factor, show your attempt and leave it on your paper. 

$$\begin{aligned} 
\text{(a) } & 2x+y+(x+2y)y' = 0 \\
\text{(b) } & x^2 y^3 + x(1+y^2)y' = 0\\

\newpage

\section{Lecture 9 on June 9th}

0. Announce the second chance club. 

1. Standard form of second order linear ODE, Homogeneous and non-homogeneous. 

2. General theory 

2.1. Existence and uniqueness theorem

Remark: Standard form! 

Remark: In case there's a regular singular point, one may find a special type of series solution (covered in the book from 5.4 to 5.6). However it is way beyond our class. 

Examples: $$\begin{aligned}
1. & t^2 y'' - 2t y' - 4y = 0, y(1)=2, y'(1) = 3 \\
2. & y'' - \tan t y' + t^3y = 0, y(0)=1, y'(0)=3 \\
\end{aligned}$$  

2.2. Principle of superposition with Wronskian: If $y_1, y_2$ are two solutions to the ODE 
$$y'' + p(t)y'+ q(t) y = 0$$
then for ANY numbers $C_1, C_2$, the function $C_1y_1 + C_2y_2$ would also be a solution. 

Example: for $y''- 2y' - 3y = 0$, we know $e^{3t}$ and $e^{-t}$ are solutions. Verify that $2e^{3t}- e^{-t}$ are also solutions. (You can compute by usual methods, but also can be computed in a way that can be generalized to a proof). 

2.3. Moreover, if $y_1$ and $y_2$ are linearly independent functions, then all solutions are of the form $c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$. In other words, 
$$y(t)=C_1y_1(t)+C_2y_2(t)$$
is the general solution to the ODE. 

Example:
$$\begin{aligned}
1. & y_1 = t^2, y_2 = t^3.\\
2. & y_1 = e^{3t}, y_2 = 5 e^{3t}\\
3. & y_1 = e^t, y_2 = 4e^{2t}\\
\end{aligned}$$

2. Second order linear homogeneous ODEs with constant coefficients:
$$ay'' + by' + cy = 0$$
We try $y = e^{rt}$, to get 
$$ar^2 + br + c=0$$
In other words, if $y=e^{rt}$ is a solution to the ODE, then $r$ must satisfy the equation $ar^2+br+c=0$

This equation has three cases:

Case 1: If we managed to solve two distinct real roots $r_1, r_2$, then since $e^{r_1t}$ and $e^{r_2t}$ are automatically linearly independent, we have the general solution
$$y=C_1e^{r_1t} + C_2 e^{r_2 t}$$

Basically quadratic formula works in all the cases

Examples:
$$\begin{aligned}
&y'' - 2y' - 3y = 0 & \text{Previous Example}\\
&y'' - 5y' + 6y = 0 & \text{Factorization Wrong}\\
&2y'' + 7y' + 3y = 0 &\text{Tricky Factorization}\\
&y'' - 4y' - 6y = 0 &\text{quadratic formula}
\end{aligned}$$

Case 2 and Case 3: Tomorrow.

1. Free Vibration

1.1. Physics background and equation of motion: A mass is attached with a spring vertically. Let $u$ be \underline{the displacement of the mass FROM THE EQUILIBRIUM} (which characterizes how the mass is stretched ``further'' from where it stays still). Then the equation of motion in general looks like
$$m u'' + \gamma u' + k u = 0$$
where $m$ stands for the \underline{mass}, $\gamma$ represent the \underline{damping}, $k$ is the \underline{spring constant}.

1.2. Undamped Case: Natural Frequency, Amplitude and Phase

Example: Suppose that a mass weighing 10 lb stretches a spring 2 in. If the mass is displaced an additional 2 in and is then set in motion with an initial upward velocity of 1 ft/s, determine the position
of the mass at any later time. Also determine the period, amplitude, and phase of the motion.

1.3. Underdamped Case: $\gamma<\sqrt{4km}$. Quasi-frequency, Quasi-Period. 

Example: A mass weighing 4 lb stretches a spring 2 in. Suppose that the mass is given an additional 6 in displacement in the positive direction and then released. The mass is in a medium that exerts a viscous resistance of 6 lb when the mass has a velocity of 3 ft/s. Formulate the IVP and solve it. 

1.4. Overdamped Case: $\gamma > \sqrt{4km}$

Example: A mass weighing 4 lb stretches a spring 1.5 in. The mass is in a medium that exerts a viscous resistance of 15 lb when the mass has a velocity of 3 ft/s. Suppose the mass is given an additional 6 in displacement. Find out the condition for the velocity such that the mass passes through the equilibrium (overshoot). 

Added June 15th: In class I actually used the following data: A mass weighing 4lb stretches a spring 2 in. 


1.5. Critically Damped Case: $\gamma = \sqrt{4km}$

Example: A mass weighing 4 lb stretches a spring 1.5 in. Suppose that the mass is given an additional 6 in displacement in the positive direction and then released. The mass is in a medium that exerts a viscous resistance of 12 lb when the mass has a velocity of 3 ft/s. Formulate the IVP and solve it

1. General Theory of nonhomogeneous linear ODE

1.1. Proposition: If $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are two solutions to 
$$y'' + p(t) y' + q(t)y = g(t)$$
then $Y_1 - Y_2$ will be a solution of 
$$y'' + p(t) y' + q(t)y = 0$$

1.2. Once we know a particular solution $Y$, then we know that
$$C_1 y_1 + C_2 y_2 + Y$$ will be a solution for any number $C_1$ and $C_2$. 

1.3. By the existence and uniqueness theorem, for any second order linear ODE, there will be at most two arbitrary constants. Therefore the above expression actually gives the general solution.

1.4. $C_1y_1 + C_2 y_2$ is referred as complementary solution. $Y$ is referred as particular solution.\\

0. Leftovers

0.1. First try template independent of left hand side

0.2. Failure of first try template,  modification, determining the correct template without trying. Use recitation notes.\\

1. Variation of parameters.

Idea: Varying the parameters in the complementary solution. 

1.1. Deduction of the equation: For the ODE
$$y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = g(t)$$
Let $C_1y_1 + C_2y_2$ be the complementary solution. Set $Y = u_1y_1 + u_2y_2$, we first compute $Y'$
$$\begin{aligned}
Y' &= u_1' y_1 + u_1y_1' + u_2' y_2 + u_2 y_2' 
\end{aligned}$$
For simplicity, we set $u_1'y_1+u_2'y_2$ to be zero, so we don't have to deal with second derivatives of $u_1$ and $u_2$. Thereby
$$\begin{aligned}
Y' &= u_1y_1' + u_2y_2' \\
Y''&= u_1'y_1' + u_1y_1'' + u_2'y_2' + u_2y_2'' \\
Y'' + pY' + q Y &= u_1y_1' + u_1y_1'' + u_2y_2' + u_2y_2'' + p(u_1y_1' + u_2y_2') + q(u_1y_1 + u_2y_2) \\
&= u_1(y_1'' + py_1' + qy_1) + u_2(y_2'' + py_2' + qy_2) + u_1'y_1' + u_2'y_2'\\
&= u_1'y_1' + u_2'y_2'
\end{aligned}$$
Setting it equal to $g$ and together with the assumption we have
$$\left\{\begin{aligned}
y_1u_1' + y_2u_2' = 0\\
y_1'u_1'+y_2'u_2' = g(t)
\end{aligned}\right.$$

1.2. Deduction of the integration formula.

1.2.1. Remark: Cramer's rule

1.3. Remark: $g(t)$ must come from the standard form! \\

2. Examples

2.1. Find the general solutions to 
$$y'' - 2y' + y = \frac{e^t}{1+t^2}$$
$$x^2 y'' - 3x y' + 4y = x^2 \ln x$$

2.2. Knowing that $y_1 = e^t$ is a solution to the ODE
$$ty'' - (1+t)y' + y = 0$$
Find the general solution to
$$ty'' - (1+t)y' + y = t^2 e^{2t}$$
 

3. Forced Undamped Vibrations. Natural frequency $\omega_0$. External Frequency $\omega$

3.1. $\omega \neq \omega_0$. General solution. Beats. 

3.2. $\omega = \omega_0$. General solution. Resonance. 

Example: Suppose that a mass weighing 4 lb stretches a spring 1.5 in. Assume there is no damping. Also the mass is subject to an external force as strong as $2\cos \omega t$ lb. At $t=0$, the mass is displaced an additional 2 in and is then set in motion with an initial upward velocity of 1 ft/s. Determine the frequency of the external force for resonance to happen and then the position of the mass at any later time. 

4. Forced Damped Vibration.

4.1. General solution

4.2. Transient solution, Steady-State solution.

Example: Suppose that a mass weighing 4 lb stretches a spring 1.5 in. The mass is in a medium that exerts a viscous resistance of 15 lb when the mass has a velocity of 3 ft/s. Also the mass is subject to an external force as strong as $2\cos 16 t$ lb. At $t=0$, the mass is displaced an additional 2 in and is then set in motion with an initial upward velocity of 1 ft/s. 

\newpage
\section*{Homework}

1. A mass weighing 2 lb stretches a spring 6 in. Assuming there's no damping in the system. If the mass is pulled down an additional 3 in and then released, meanwhile is acted on by an additional oscillating force with amplitude 1 lb and phase 0. Find out the frequency of the force such that resonance happen, and determine the position at any time $t$ by solving the system. 

2. With all the data as above, suppose for now the system is subject to a damping force that is as strong as 2 lb when the velocity of the mass is 4 ft/s. Find the transient solution and the steady-state solution. 

3. Find the general solution to the following ODEs
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{(a)  } & y'' + y = \tan t\\
\text{(b)  } & 4y'' + y = 2 \sec(t/2)\\
\text{(c)  } & x^2 y'' - 2y = 3x^2 - 1, x>0\\
\end{aligned}
$$

4. Knowing $y_1$ is a solution to the homogeneous ODE, find the general solution to the following ODEs
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{(a)  } & y_1 = x, x^2 y'' - x(x+2)y' + (x+2) y(x) = 2x^2, x>0\\
\text{(b)  } & y_1 = e^x, (1-x)y'' + xy' - y = 2(1-x)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

5. (Bonus) Apply the variation of parameters to the first order linear ODE
$$y' + p(t) y = g(t)$$
to obtain the formula of the general solution. 
(Hint: Solve the homogeneous ODE $y' + p(t)y = 0$ first to get the complementary solution $Cy_1$. Then set $Y(t)=u(t)y_1(t)$ and put in the ODE to find $Y$. So the general solution would then be $Cy_1 + Y$. 

Solutions:

1. $\omega = 8$. Solution: $u = 0.25 \cos 8t + t \sin 8t$

2. $u(t) = C_1 e^{-4t}\cos 4\sqrt 3 t + C_2 e^{-4t} \sin 4\sqrt 3 t + \frac 1 4 \sin 8t$. 

3. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{(a)  } & y = C_1 \cos t + C_2 \sin t - \ln|\sec t + \tan t| \cos t\\
\text{(b)  } & y = C_1 \cos \frac t 2 + C_2 \sin \frac t 2 + t\sin \frac t 2 + 2\cos \frac t 2 \ln|\cos frac t 2|\\
\text{(c)  } & y = C_1 x^2 + C_2 \frac 1 x + \frac 1 2 + x^2 \ln x. \\
\end{aligned}
$$

4. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{(a)  } & y = C_1 x + C_2 xe^x - 2x\ln x - 2xe^{x} \int \frac 1 {xe^x}dx\\
\text{(b)  } & y = C_1 x + C_2 e^x - 2x \ln(x-1) + e^x \int \frac{2x}{(x-1)e^x}dx \\

Nonhomogeneous ODE

0.3. Structure of Solution: $y= y_c + Y$.

and $Y_2$ is a particular solution to
$$a_ny^{(n)} + a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 y' + a_0 = g_2(t)$$

1.4. If $r$ is a real single root, then it contributes to one function in the fundamental set of solutions
$$e^{rt}$$

1.5. If $r$ is a real root repeated $m$ times, then it contributes to the following $m$ functions in the fundamental set of solutions
$$e^{rt}, te^{rt}, \cdots, t^{m-1}e^{rt}$$

1.6. If $r=\alpha + i\beta$ is a complex root repeated $m$ times, we know from algebra that the root $\overline{r} = \alpha-i\beta$ should also be repeated $m$ times. They contributes to $2m$ functions in the fundamental set of solutions

1. Review of power series

1.1. A power series centered at a point $x_0$ is an infinite series of the form
$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (x-x_0)^n$$

1.2. Radius of convergence: if $|x-x_0|<r$ then the series converges, if $|x-x_0|>r$ then the series diverges, if $|x-x_0|=r$ we can't tell in general. 

1.3. $R = \lim_{n\to \infty} \left|\frac {a_n}{a_{n+1}}\right|$

1.4. Why study power series:

1.4.1. Near every point, every elementary function (exp, log, trig., inverse trig.) admits a series expansion, by Taylor's theorem.

1.4.2. There are a lot more functions that cannot be expressed as elementary functions, yet can be expressed as power series. Example: $\int_{-\infty}^x e^{-x^2}$. 

1.4.3. In general one can ALWAYS find series solutions, if the coefficients satisfies certain regularity. 

2. Dr. Gross's Video Lecture

3. More Examples: $(2+x^2)y'' - xy' + 4y = 0$, $e^xy''+ xy = 0$

\newpage

\section*{Homework}

1. Find the first four terms in each of two solutions $y_1$ and $y_2$ (unless the series terminates
sooner) about the given point $x_0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{(a)  }& y'' - xy' - y = 0, x_0 = 1\\
\text{(b)  }& y'' - xy' - y = 0, x_0 = 0\\
\text{(c)  }& y'' + xy' + 2y = 0, x_0 = 0\\
\text{(d)  }& x^2 y'' - x(x+2)y' + (x+2)y = 0, x_0 = 0\\
\text{(e)  }& (3-x^2) y'' - 3x y' - y = 0, x_0 = 0\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Added 12:15PM: Problem 1d is set to be a bonus problem. It can still be solved using the techniques we talked about in class but just accidentally, due to the reason that $x_0$ is indeed a singular point (which does not belong to our current syllabus). Also Problem 1e was changed due to the same reason. Also in Problem 1d, the recurrence relation is indeed tricky to solve. 

2. Determine a lower bound for the radius of convergence of series solutions about each given point $x_0$ for the given differential equation.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{(a)  }&y'' + 4y' + 6xy = 0; x_0 = 0, x_0 = 4\\
\text{(b)  }& (x^2 - 2x - 3)y'' + xy + 4y = 0; x_0 = 4, x_0 = -4, x_0 = 0\\
\text{(c)  }& (1 + x^3)y'' + 4xy' + y = 0; x_0 = 0, x_0 = 2\\
\text{(d)  }& xy'' + y = 0; x_0 = 1

1. General theory systems of first order linear ODEs
$$\overrightarrow{x}'(t) = A(t) \overrightarrow{x}(t)$$
In $n$-variable case
$$\left\{\begin{array}{c}
x_1'= p_{11}(t) x_1 + \cdots + p_{1n}(t)x_n + g_1(t)\\
x_2'= p_{21}(t) x_1 + \cdots + p_{2n}(t)x_n + g_2(t)\\
\cdots \cdots \cdots \\
x_n'= p_{n1}(t) x_1 + \cdots + p_{nn}(t)x_n + g_n(t)\\
\end{array}\right.$$

Existence and Uniqueness Theorem: If $p_{ij}(t), i,j = 1, ..., n$ and $g_i(t), i=1, ... , n$ are continuous over an interval $(\alpha,\beta)$ that contains $t_0$, then there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem 
$$\left\{\begin{array}{c}
x_1'= p_{11}(t) x_1 + \cdots + p_{1n}(t)x_n + g_1(t)\\
x_2'= p_{21}(t) x_1 + \cdots + p_{2n}(t)x_n + g_2(t)\\
\cdots \cdots \cdots \\
x_n'= p_{n1}(t) x_1 + \cdots + p_{nn}(t)x_n + g_n(t)\\
\end{array}\right., x_1(t_0)=x_1^0, \cdots, x_n(t_0)=x_n^0,$$
over the interval $(\alpha, \beta)$. 

Remark: We'll only focus on the homogeneous system, i.e., the case when all $g_i(t) = 0$. \\

Principle of Superposition: Vector functions $\overrightarrow{x^{(1)}}(t), \cdots, \overrightarrow{x^{(n)}}(t)$ are linearly independent solutions to the system $\overrightarrow{x}'(t) = A(t) x(t)$, then the general solution to the linear homogeneous system is 
$$\overrightarrow{x}(t) = C_1 \overrightarrow{x^{(1)}}(t)+ \cdots+ C_n\overrightarrow{x^{(n)}}(t)$$

Linearly independent means the Wronskian of the vector functions are not constantly zero. \\

2. System of Linear ODEs with Constant coefficients:
$$\overrightarrow{x}'(t)=A \overrightarrow{x}(t) $$

\section{Lecture 27 on July 9, 2015}
The main character we are talking about is the following system
$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}
x' = F(x,y)\\
y' = G(x,y)
\end{array}\right.$$
where $F(x,y)$ and $G(x,y)$ are functions depending on two variables, continuously differentiable. Note that neither $F$ or $G$ depends on the time $t$. This feature makes an autonomous system. 

\section{Geometric Interpretation of the system}
Consider the following initial value problem 
$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}
x' = F(x,y)\\
y' = G(x,y)
\end{array}\right., \quad \left\{\begin{array}{l}
x(t_0) = x_0\\
y(t_0) = y_0
\end{array}\right.$$
Denote the actual solution of the IVP by 
$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}
x = \varphi(t)\\
y = \psi(t)
\end{array}\right.$$
As is seen in Calc 3, over the $xy$-plane, the solution gives a curve that passes through the point $(x_0, y_0)$. The $xy$-plane is referred as \textbf{phase plane}. This curve is referred as the \textbf{integral curve (trajectory,  orbit)} of the system. 

Although an explicit solution cannot be expected, there is one piece of information that can be drawn: the derivatives at the initial time $t_0$, namely $\varphi'(t_0)$, and $\psi'(t_0)$ can be obtained directly from the differential equations
$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\varphi'(t_0) = F(x_0, y_0)\\
\psi'(t_0) = G(x_0,y_0)
\end{array}\right.$$
Understood geometrically, over the $xy$-plane, the tangent vector of the curve at the initial time $t_0$ is known. Moreover, note that $F$ and $G$ are independent of $t_0$, one can choose $t_0$ to be any number without changing the tangent vector. So in other words, we have the following important observation:

\textit{On the phase plane, any integral curve of the system that passes through the point $(x_0,y_0)$ has the tangent vector $\langle F(x_0, y_0), G(x_0, y_0)\rangle$ at the point $(x_0, y_0)$}

The above observation can be applied to every point $(x_0, y_0)$ on the plane, thereby yields a vector field over the phase plane
$$(x_0, y_0)\mapsto \left[\begin{array}{l}
F(x_0, y_0)\\
G(x_0, y_0)
\end{array}\right]$$
This vector field is referred as the \textbf{direction field}. 

Remark: The direction field makes sense only when the system is autonomous and the vector field is invariant over time. 

Example: Draw the direction field for the system
$$\left\{\begin{array}{l}
x' = 2x + y\\
y' = x + 2y
\end{array}\right.$$

\section{Qualitative behavior of the Linear systems}

For linear homogeneous autonomous systems, since we know the general solution, we can expect to have full information about the all the integral curves. The phase plane together with a representative set of integral curves are referred as the \textbf{phase portrait}.
